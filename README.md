This is a profit prediction model, which predicts the 
profit of startup companies. This machine-learning model will be quite helpful in 
such a situation where we need to find a profit 
based on how much we are spending in the market and 
for the market. In a nutshell, this machine learning model 
will help us to find the profit based on the amount  
we spend from the 50 startup companies dataset.
